    "### What it this?\n",
    "\n",
    "This script imports images, resizes them and pastes them on a background. The latter step is done three ways: using a plain background, a heavily cluttered and a lightly cluttered one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the script manipulates cluttered backgrounds so that their pixel value histogram matches that of the average object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Very good question. First check the following requirements:\n",
    "1. Make sure this script is located in a directory (`script`) of which the parent directory contains a folder named `COCOimages` and where all the images you wish to work on are located. Those should be images with a `.png` extension, containing objects on transparent backgrounds.\n",
    "2. Make sure the parent directory also contains a `bckgrndImages > scrambled_light_clutter` and a `bckgrndImages > scrambled_heavy_clutter` folder, which contain the necessary cluttered background images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the parameters that need to be set before running the script (check `Preamble`):\n",
    "- `outSize` defines the final resolution of output images (700x700 by default).\n",
    "- `obj_imRatio` defines the space the object will take in the final image. More precisely it corresponds to the ratio of the longer side of the object (width/height) to the size of the image (700 by default).\n",
    "- `col_bckgrnd` defines the color of the plain backgrounds in grayscale value. Leave this value commented out by default: it will take the average pixel value of all objects."
