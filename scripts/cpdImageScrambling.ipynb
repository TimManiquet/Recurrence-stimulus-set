    "### What it this?\n",
    "\n",
    "This script takes images from a given directory and returns their phase scrambled version. It does so using a cutoff value between low- and high-pass that is based on **cycles per degree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Very good question. First check the following requirements:\n",
    "1. Make sure this script is located in a directory (`scripts`) of which the parent directory contains a folder named `images`, where all the images you wish to work on are located.\n",
    "2. Make sure the input images are 4-channel, with the background gray & transparent.\n",
    "3. Input the following values in the preamble:\n",
    "    - A `dva` value, indicating how big images will appear to participants during the experiment.\n",
    "    - A cutoff value in `cpd` to determine the low- and high-pass threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script will operate the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. From the input parameters, calculate the `cpi` threshold value that will be used next.\n",
    "1. _Fourier transform_ images.\n",
    "2. Create a _mask_ for the low- and high-pass scrambling.\n",
    "3. Replace the masked values of the original phase spectrum with the _phase spectrum of random noise_, above and below this threshold for low- and high-pass scrambled images, respectively."
